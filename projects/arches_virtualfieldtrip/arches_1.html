      <p>Rocks have attracted visitors to Arches  National Park for thousands of years. However, sightseeing has not been  the main activity for very long. Hunter-gatherers migrated into the  area about 10,000 years ago at the end of the Ice Age. As they explored  Courthouse Wash and other areas in what is now Arches, they found  pockets of chert and chalcedony, microcrystalline quartz perfect for  making stone tools. Chipping or knapping these rocks into dart points,  knives, and scrapers, they created debris piles that are still visible  to the trained eye.</p>
      <p>Then, roughly two thousand years ago, the  nomadic hunters and gatherers began cultivating certain plants and  settled into the Four Corners region. These early agriculturalists,  known as the ancestral Puebloan and Fremont people, raised domesticated  maize, beans, and squash, and lived in villages like those preserved at  Mesa Verde National Park.</p>
      <p>While no dwellings have been found in  Arches, the northern edge of ancestral Puebloan territory, there are  rock inscription panels. Like earlier people, the ancestral Puebloans  left lithic scatters, often overlooking waterholes where someone may  have shaped tools while watching for game. People living in modern-day  pueblos like Acoma, Cochiti, Santa Clara, Taos, and the Hopi Mesas are  descendants of the ancestral Puebloans.</p>
      <p>The Fremont were  contemporaries of the ancestral Puebloans and lived in the same general  area, so distinctions between the two cultures are blurry. However,  Fremont rock inscriptions, pottery and other artifacts clearly  demonstrate the existence of different technologies and traditions.  Both the Fremont and the ancestral Puebloans left the region about 700  years ago.</p>
    <p>As the ancestral Puebloan and Fremont peoples were  leaving, nomadic Shoshonean peoples such as the Ute and Paiute entered  the area and were here to meet the first Europeans in 1776. The  petroglyph panel near Wolfe Ranch is believed to have some Ute images  since it shows people on horseback, and horses were adopted by the Utes  only after they were introduced by the Spanish.</p>
