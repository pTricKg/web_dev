      <p>The red rocks of Arches National Park  were deposited in layers over millions of years. <br />
        Later,  erosion carved them into the features seen today. Water, ice, and very hot and  cold temperatures cause erosion. </p>
      <p>Seas covered this  region 300 million years ago. When they dried up they left behind thousands<br />
of feet of salt. Later, layers of sand and other sediments  covered the salt. When buried, the<br />
sediments were  compressed into sedimentary rock. The buried salt moved under the pressure of  the overlying sediment like toothpaste in a tube. As the salt moved, it ran into  underground faults or barriers that caused the salt to go upward. Near the  earthâ€™s surface, the salt formed what looked like long giant bubbles in the  upper layers.</p>
