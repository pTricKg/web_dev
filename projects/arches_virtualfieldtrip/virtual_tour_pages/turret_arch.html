    <p>In  1973 it was decided that in order for a hole in the rock to be considered an  arch it had to have an opening of at least three feet. Even if the opening is  one inch high, as long as it is three feet long, it counts as an arch. While you  are visiting the park, keep your eyes open because if you find a new arch, you  get to name it. Many arches have been named for their shapes such as Pork Chop  arch and Piano Leg arch. There are over 2000 documented arches in the park and  probably some more to be found.</p>
