    <p>Most  animals in this desert climate are nocturnal; that is, they eat, drink and move  about at night. Fifty-two kinds of mammals have been sighted in the park. Mule  deer, bighorn sheep, cottontail rabbits, kit fox and ground squirrels are seen  frequently. Birds are common certain times of the year and in certain locations.  At least 186 kinds of birds have been seen in the Park. Common ones <br />
      include  pinyon jays, mountain bluebirds, red-tailed hawks and ravens. Visitors who leave  their cars during the warm part of the year are almost guaranteed to see  lizards! Shy midget-faded rattlesnakes are also present, but are seldom seen. </p>
