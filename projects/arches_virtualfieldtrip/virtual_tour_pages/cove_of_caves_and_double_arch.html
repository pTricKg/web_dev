    <p>Believe  it or not, the hot temperatures (up to 114 degrees Fahrenheit) in the summer  are just one of the many harsh conditions for the animals that live here.  Animal adaptations are also aimed at coping with the dryness, lack of food, and  extreme temperature changes.</p>
    <p>Every  animal needs water to live. In the desert, water isnâ€™t always there when you  need it. Humans have a great advantage because we can plan ahead, fill up our  water bottles, and carry as much water as needed (in the summer, about four  quarts per person per day). Animals have to find water nearby on a regular  basis, unless they can fly or walk a long way.</p>
