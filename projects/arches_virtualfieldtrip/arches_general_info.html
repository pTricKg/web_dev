<p>Arches National Park preserves over 2,000 natural sandstone arches,  like the world-famous Delicate Arch, as well asÂ many other unusual rock  formations. In some areas, the forces of nature have exposed millions  of years of geologic history. The extraordinary features of the park  create a landscape of contrasting colors, landforms and textures that  is unlike any other in the world.</p>
      <p>The forces of nature have acted in concert to create the landscape  of Arches, which contains the greatest density of natural arches in the  world. Throughout the park, rock layers reveal millions of years of  deposition, erosion and other geologic events. These layers continue to  shape life in Arches today, as their erosion influences elemental  features like soil chemistry and where water flows when it rains.</p>
      <p>Arches is located in a &quot;high desert,&quot; with elevations ranging from  4,085 to 5,653 feet above sea level. The climate is one of very hot  summers, cold winters and very little rainfall. Even on a daily basis,  temperatures may fluctuate as much as 50 degrees.</p>
    <p>The plants and animals in Arches have many adaptations that enable  them to survive these conditions. Some species are found only in this  area. The diversity of organisms reflects the variety of available  habitat, which includes lush riparian areas, ephemeral pools, dry  arroyos, mixed grasslands and large expanses of bare rock.</p>
