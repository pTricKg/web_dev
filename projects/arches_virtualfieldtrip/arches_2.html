      <p>The first Europeans to  explore the Southwest were Spaniards. As Spain’s New World empire  expanded, they searched for travel routes across the deserts to their  California missions. In fact, the Old Spanish Trail linking Santa Fe  and Los Angeles ran along the same route, past the park visitor center,  that the highway does today.</p>
      <p>The first reliable date within  Arches is an interesting one. Denis Julien, a French-American trapper  with a habit of chiseling his name and the date onto rocks throughout  the Southwest, left an inscription in this area: Denis Julien, June 9,  1844. If we only knew what he thought of the wonders he saw!</p>
      <p>The  first European settlement of Southern Utah arose from the colonizing  efforts of the Mormon Church. The Mormons attempted to establish the  Elk Mountain Mission in what is now Moab in June of 1855, but conflicts  with the Utes caused them to abandon the effort. In the 1880s and  1890s, Moab was settled permanently by ranchers, prospectors, and  farmers. One settler even found a beautiful spot within what is now  Arches National Park. John Wesley Wolfe, a veteran of the Civil War,  built the homestead known as Wolfe Ranch around 1898, seeking good  fortune in the newly established State of Utah. It is located on Salt  Wash, at the beginning of the Delicate Arch Trail. Wolfe and his family  lived there a decade or more, then moved back to Ohio. The cabin  remains, an echo of what must have been a remarkable experience.</p>
      <p>One  of the earliest settlers to describe the beauty of the red rock country  around Arches was Loren “Bish” Taylor, who took over the Moab newspaper  in 1911 when he was eighteen years old. Bish editorialized for years  about the marvels of Moab, and loved exploring and describing the rock  wonderland just north of the frontier town. Some of his journeys were  with John “Doc” Williams, Moab’s first doctor. As Doc rode his horse  north to ranches and other settlements, he often climbed out of Salt  Valley to the spot now called Doc Williams Point, stopped to let his  horse rest and looked back over the fabulously colored rock fins.</p>
    <p>Word  spread. Alexander Ringhoffer, a prospector, wrote the Rio Grande  Western Railroad in 1923 in an effort to publicize the area and gain  support for creating a national park. Ringhoffer led railroad  executives interested in attracting more rail passengers into the  formations; they were impressed, and the campaign began. The government  sent research teams to investigate and gather evidence. On April 12,  1929 President Herbert Hoover signed the legislation creating Arches  National Monument, to protect the arches, spires, balanced rocks, and  other sandstone formations. On November 12, 1971 congress changed the  status of Arches to a National Park, recognizing over 10,000 years of  cultural history that flourished in this now famous landscape of  sandstone arches and canyons.</p>
