             The Maxwell House,    landmarked in 2004, is believed to have been built in 1898, although some    family narratives say the home was completed in 1905. The house retains some    of its original architectural features, including cedar clapboard siding, a    stacked flagstone foundation and cellar, original porch columns and interior    doors. But the relatively simple cottage is more significant for its role in    the social history of Lafayette.    Original owner David Maxwell, then 23, and his wife Ellen Dick Maxwell, then    17, left Scotland and    landed in Pennsylvania    in April 1881. In 1884, they moved to Walsenburg and then, a year later, to a    homestead near Erie.    In May of 1890, the family moved to town and eventually built their home at 406 E. Baseline Road.    A miner by trade, and an early organizer of unionization activities in local    mines, David Maxwell was seriously injured in a workplace accident that ended    his mining career and caused him to wear a shoe that was built up several    inches. He was a member of the I.O.O.F. and the United Mine Workers of    America. He was also a member of the Lafayette Volunteer Fire Department. One    of Maxwells’ sons, John “Scotty” Maxwell and his wife, Kate McNeill Maxwell,    lived in the home from 1930 to 1942. He was a member of the Lafayette Fire    Department, a justice of the peace, a president of the United Mine Workers    Local and a sergeant at Arms at a National Coalminers Union in Chicago. &nbsp;Their    other children were Ann Maxwell Coward, Julian Maxwell Irwin, Jean Maxwell    Gaboury, David E. Maxwell, Cecil Maxwell and Gilbert Ronald Maxwell.    David and Ellen Maxwell made Lafayette    their home until their deaths, his in 1936 and hers in 1945. The home now is    owned by Janet Richardson and her family.</p></td>
